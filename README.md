Blue Brain Technology: A Subway to Artiﬁcial Intelligence

**The Blue Brain Project - A quest to build sentient machines is the ﬁrst made comprehensive attempt to reverse-engineer thebrainofmammalian, sothatthroughdetailedsimulationsthefunction of brain can be understood. BLUE BRAIN is the name of the world’s ﬁrst virtual brain which means, a machine that can function as human brain.

**Today, scientists are in research to create an artiﬁcial brain that can think, respond, take decision, and store anything in memory. The main aim of this research is to upload human brain into machine. So that man can think and take decision without any eﬀort. After the death of the body, the virtual brain will act as the man. So, even after the death of a person we will not lose the knowledge, intelligence, personalities, feelings and memories of that man that can be used for the development of the human society.
